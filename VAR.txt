Vector autoregression (VAR) is a statistical model used to capture the relationship between multiple quantities as they change over time. 
VAR is a type of stochastic process model. VAR models generalize the single-variable (univariate) autoregressive model by allowing for multivariate time series.
VAR models are often used in economics and the natural sciences.
Like the autoregressive model, each variable has an equation modelling its evolution over time. 
This equation includes the variable's lagged (past) values, the lagged values of the other variables in the model, and an error term. 
VAR models do not require as much knowledge about the forces influencing a variable as do structural models with simultaneous equations. 
The only prior knowledge required is a list of variables which can be hypothesized to affect each other over time.
